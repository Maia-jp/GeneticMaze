### Genetic Maze
Can machines learn? if so, how much processing power is needed?
Seeking to demonstrate the answers to these questions, I developed the Genetic Maze project. 
A program that allows you to demonstrate the learning power of a machine in a simple problem: getting from one end to the other of a "maze". Learning is done through a concept known with a genetic algorithm.

### What is a genetic algorithm?
In short, a genetic algorithm (aka GA) simulates natural selection to solve an optimization problem.
For this purpose, several organisms are created, in our case "red" cells.
Each red cell receives a gene, which is nothing more than a series of instructions on how to move through the maze.
The cells are grouped in generations that live for a certain time, at the end of life the best, that is, those that came closest to a solution are chosen to pass their genes on to the next generation (their children)
In this way, each generation approaches a solution: and thus a population of simulated individuals learns to solve a certain problem.

### Installation
Should such a program use a lot of power then?
The answer is no. This program made in javascript can be run on any PC with minimum requirements such as a connection to the internet and a browser

To execute it just download the folder and open the file "main.html"
preferably with Google Chrome
